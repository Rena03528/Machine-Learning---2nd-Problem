Second Problem - The ARX Model 

The ARX model (Auto Regressive with eXogenous input) enables the representation discrete input- output dynamical systems described by linear difference equations, in which the observation noise in one sample is independent of the noise in other samples

This repository have the jupyter notebooks with the all implementations to solve the second problem and some python files with functions that we quote on our final report.
